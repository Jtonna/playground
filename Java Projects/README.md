## Welcome to my Java Playground

Inside this portion of the repository you will find some sub directories ending with 'LS' this stands for Lambda School & these are projects I've worked on based on in-class content.

All of the other folders are individual side projects just for testing & learning new things.



## Movie Microservices

This Project Explores using microservices using tools like Spring Cloud, Eureka, RestTemplate & WebClient.

The project has a discovery server, and 3 micro-servers with the movie-catalog-service acting as the gateway service connecting to the other two services for information.

The project was based on JavaBrains Spring Boot Microservices Level 1 tutorial series.
