## Welcome to my Java Playground

Inside this portion of the repository you will find some sub directories ending with 'LS' this stands for Lambda School & these are projects I've worked on based on in-class content.

All of the other folders are individual side projects just for testing & learning new things.



## Movie Microservices

This project is from [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8IQb4ofjDo&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZSKAFG6aCDVDP86Qx4lNas) on YouTube, where he discusses and shows examples of developing Microservices & having them communicate with each other. In this example we will be using both ways of discovering microservices, Hardcoded addresses & Discovery.
