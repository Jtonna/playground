# Projects

## Async Await

This project was designed to re-aquaint myself to Async principals. Fairly simple stuff.

## Dan Abramov (Just JavaScript)

This project is based on a series of email's from Dan Abramov that display his understanding of javascript. Im basically just reading the emails and writing code to gain a "hands on" understanding of topics compared to just reading.
